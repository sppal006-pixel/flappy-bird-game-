🎮 How to Run
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Ensure all files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, sounds) are kept in their respective directory structure.

Open index.html in any modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Press Enter to start the game.

Use the Up Arrow or Spacebar to flap the bird's wings and navigate through the pipes.


🔮 Future Enhancements
Implement a local storage-based High Score system.

Add character selection/skins for the bird
